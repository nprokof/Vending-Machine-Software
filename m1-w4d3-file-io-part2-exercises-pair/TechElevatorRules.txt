There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went
back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at
any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this
time she found a little SPORTSCAR!! on it ("which certainly was not here
before," said Alice,) and tied round the neck of the SPORTSCAR!! was a paper
label, with the words "DRINK ME" beautifully printed on it in large
letters.

It was all very well to say "Drink me," but the wise little Alice was
not going to do _that_ in a hurry. "No, I'll look first," she said, "and
see whether it's marked '_poison_' or not;" for she had read several
nice little stories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by
wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, all because they _would_ not
remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a
red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that, if you
cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she
had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a SPORTSCAR!! marked
"poison," it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.
